### Non-Breaking

- Change the randomness stabilization window for Conway (and future eras) to
  `4k/f` instead of `3k/f` (one stability window) that was used for Babbage and
  TPraos-based eras. See erratum 17.3 in the Shelley ledger specs for context.

  Note that this is a backwards-incompatible change for all existing chains
  containing (at least one full epoch worth of) Conway blocks.
